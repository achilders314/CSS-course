         <p>I'm an entry level developer looking to land my first development job. Being a former teacher, I may have an unusual skillset, 
         but I have many transferable skills. I have already worked with HTML, CSS, and Java either in college or learning coding on my own.  
         But even more than my coding skill, I am a lifelong learner who's always hungry to learn more. Having a math mind, I'm used to persevering
         with puzzles, and coding is just a giant puzzle.  I love working in a collaborative environment and know I would be an asset to any
          team. </p>
